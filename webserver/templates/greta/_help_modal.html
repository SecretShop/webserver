        <h4>Installing Git</h4>
        <span class="label label-important">Before you get too far...</span>
        <strong>You'll need to have git installed</strong>
        <p>
          GitHub has a lovely document that describes the process for
          installing git on different platforms. You can find
          it <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">here</a>
        </p>

        <h4>Ready to get started?</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click the <code>View Clone Command</code> button
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy the git clone command that pops up
          </li>
          <li>
            Paste the command into your favorite terminal
            emulator.
          </li>
          <li>
            When git prompts you for a password, type in your team's git
            password. Can't remember it? Just click the <code>View Team
              Password</code> button.
          </li>
          <li>That's it!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You should now have a local copy of your client
          repository. Feel free to write some code!
        </p>

        <h4>What's my git password?</h4>
        <p>
          Since every team member needs a password to clone code, we've
          set up a group password to your repository. You can view your
          password by clicking <code>View Team Password</code> on your
          team's repository page. You can also change your team's git
          password at any time by clicking <code>Change Team
            Password</code>.
        </p>

        <h4>Pro Tips</h4>
        <p>
          Be sure to commit your code early and often. You can push your
          code to megaminerai.com at any time. Whenever you push or pull
          code, you will need to use your team's git password.
        </p>
